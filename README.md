# Email-Spam-using-NLP
Detection of spam email messages using NLP
Tensorflow, a modelling framework, was used to create the model. 15 EPOCHS were used to train the model. 
I repeatedly trained the model until I had the best one. The saved model is located in the Spam Model1 directory.
Consult the tensorflow documentation (https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/save and serialize) to learn how to save and load a pretrained model. 
I received a Training accuracy of 1.000 (100%) and a Validation accuracy of 0.8820 for this stored model (88.2 percent ).
